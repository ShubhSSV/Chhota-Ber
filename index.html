                <br>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Chota Ber (Ziziphus nummularia) is highly valued in traditional medicine for its health benefits. The plant is known for its fruit, which is rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and essential minerals, making it effective in boosting immunity. The fruit is used as a remedy for digestive issues, skin disorders, and respiratory ailments. Additionally, the leaves and bark are believed to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which are beneficial for treating wounds and skin infections. Chota Ber also has a cooling effect on the body and is commonly used in Ayurvedic treatments to balance the body’s heat levels.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Chota Ber typically flowers from July to September, and its fruits are ready for harvest in the winter season, usually from November to February. The plant thrives in warm climates and can produce fruit even during dry spells, making it resilient to variations in seasonal rainfall. Its fruit-bearing season provides a reliable source of nutrition and medicinal benefits at times when other fruit-bearing plants may be less productive, especially in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Chota Ber is native to South Asia and is commonly found in India, Pakistan, and other parts of the Indian subcontinent. It flourishes in arid and semi-arid regions, where it is well-adapted to harsh climates and poor soil conditions. The plant is commonly found in open scrublands, sandy plains, and dry forest areas, particularly in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of North India. Due to its adaptability, it also serves as a critical source of food and shelter for local wildlife in these regions.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Chota Ber is a hardy perennial shrub that can live for several decades, with some plants reaching 20-30 years or more if well-maintained. This longevity makes it an excellent resource for sustainable agriculture and soil conservation efforts. The plant’s deep root system also contributes to its long lifespan, enabling it to access underground water sources and withstand droughts. As it matures, the plant produces larger and more abundant fruits, making it more beneficial as it ages.</p>
